Affirmation of Faith
HEIDELBERG CATECHISM Q&A 26 
Q. (LEADER):  What do you believe when you say: I believe in God the Father 
almighty, Creator of heaven and earth? 
A. (CONGREGATION):  [I believe] that the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
who out of nothing created heaven and earth and all that is in them, and who 
still upholds and governs them by His eternal counsel and providence, is, for the 
sake of Christ His Son, my God and my Father. In Him I trust so completely as 
to have no doubt that He will provide me with all things necessary for body  
and soul, and will also turn to my good whatever adversity He sends me in  
this life of sorrow. He is able to do so as almighty God, and willing also as a 
faithful Father.
